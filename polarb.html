            <h1>Polar Bear Diet</h1>

            <p>Polar bears, the apex predators of the Arctic, have a specialized and predominantly carnivorous diet that is uniquely adapted to their icy habitat. Their primary prey is seals, especially ringed and bearded seals, which they hunt from sea ice platforms and breathing holes. These seals are rich in fat, providing the polar bear with the high-energy content needed to survive in the harsh Arctic environment. During the seal hunting season, polar bears are known to patiently wait near seal breathing holes, or stalk seals on the ice, utilizing their keen sense of smell and excellent swimming skills. However, as climate change impacts their environment and sea ice diminishes, polar bears face challenges in accessing seals, forcing them to rely more on scavenging, bird eggs, and the occasional terrestrial mammals like reindeer or carrion when seal hunting becomes less viable. Polar bears' remarkable adaptation to their frozen realm and their reliance on seals underline their vulnerability to the rapidly changing Arctic ecosystem.</p>

            <h1>Polar Bear Habitat</h1>

            <p>Polar bears are uniquely adapted to the extreme and unforgiving habitats of the Arctic, where they are primarily found on sea ice. Sea ice serves as both their hunting grounds and a platform for resting and traveling across vast expanses of the Arctic Ocean. These bears are most commonly seen along the ice edges and areas with high seal densities, as seals make up the majority of their diet. During the winter months, polar bears venture deep into the pack ice in search of seals that surface at breathing holes. In the summer, as the ice recedes, they may come ashore on islands or along the coasts, but their reliance on sea ice remains crucial for accessing seals and conserving energy. The ongoing effects of climate change, leading to the shrinking of Arctic sea ice, present a significant challenge to polar bear habitats, as they are forced to travel longer distances and expend more energy in search of prey, making their conservation a critical concern in the face of a warming climate.</p>
