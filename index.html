            <h1>Brown Bear Diet</h1>

            <p>Brown bears have a diverse and adaptable diet that varies seasonally to meet their nutritional needs. These formidable omnivores are opportunistic feeders, consuming a wide range of foods. During spring and early summer, their diet primarily consists of fresh vegetation such as grasses, sedges, and new plant growth. As summer progresses, they incorporate berries, particularly in regions with abundant fruit-bearing shrubs. In the fall, brown bears shift their focus to fattening up for hibernation by feasting on salmon in coastal areas or scavenging for carrion and foraging for nuts and fruits in inland forests. Their powerful jaws and sharp claws enable them to also hunt small mammals and occasionally larger prey like moose or deer. This dietary flexibility is essential for their survival in various habitats, making brown bears one of the most adaptable and resourceful predators in the animal kingdom.</p>

            <h1>Brown Bear Habitat</h1>

            <p>Brown bears, with their remarkable adaptability, inhabit a diverse range of ecosystems across North America, Europe, and Asia. They can be found in environments as varied as dense forests, mountainous regions, tundra, and even coastal areas. In the dense woodlands, brown bears establish territories with ample cover for foraging and denning, while mountainous regions provide access to a wide variety of foods, from vegetation in lower elevations to game animals in higher altitudes. In the Arctic tundra, they navigate the vast, open spaces in search of prey like seals and caribou. Coastal regions offer a unique opportunity for brown bears to feast on nutrient-rich salmon runs, a critical food source for their survival. This adaptability to diverse habitats showcases the brown bear's ability to thrive in a wide array of ecosystems, a testament to their resilience and ecological significance.</p>
